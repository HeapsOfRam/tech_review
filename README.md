# Tech Review: Controversy Detection

Author: Ryan March (ryanm14)

## Topic

Review of a variety of different approaches to Controversy Detection, like Unsupervised Explainable Controversy Detection, Controversy Detection in Social Networks, etc

## Abstract

Detecting controversy in text is a valuable endeavor that provides many benefits. For example,
detecting controversy on the web can help inform discourse on a large scale (such as nationwide or
even worldwide). Identifying controversial topics has impact not just in political arenas – where
spirited debates are crucial for evaluating appropriate legislation and policies – but also in a myriad of
other venues such as entertainment and media. To demonstrate the utility of detecting controversy in
subjects other than politics, imagine a production company that wishes to evaluate the polarity around a
certain show to determine whether or not another season of it would be lucrative. Sometimes
controversy could even be seen as desirable (if the adage "no publicity is bad publicity" is to be
believed, at least in certain contexts)! However, controversy detection remains a difficult task for
multiple reasons. First, society is dynamic, and the rubric for contentiousness is fluid and changing.
Second, controversies are like ideologies in that they are latent instead of explicitly referenced. Finally,
controversy spans a wide range of topics and is often accompanied by domain-specific vocabulary [1].
Since automatic mechanisms for detecting controversy prove to be both meaningful and challenging,
researchers in the text mining space have developed multiple approaches to detect controversial topics.
These approaches have had varying results, strengths, limitations, and applications.

## Prompt

Please enter your topics [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWAyxd82FcitN9eG3yMW6ckq6l1VASBtYWpaPbywMPc/edit?usp=sharing) by Week 8 (Oct 17). You may choose a topic already chosen by other students (e.g. Survey of text mining toolkits) but please make sure that your review covers something novel that is not available online or in other students' submissions. The "description" column in the sign up sheet should help identify whether your review is unique or not. So, please read the desciptions of other students who've chosen a similar topic as you. You should also provide sufficient details in your description to help others decide.


Some sample topics have been provided [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yeKm8hJbyRGhiUDvZv9-S3Zzu5hDtET-O6Yeci-VPOs/edit?usp=sharing). You are free to use them or come up with your own topics!
